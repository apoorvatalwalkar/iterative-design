                Warp is a startup trying to modernize the conventional terminal with artificial intelligence features.
                With features like automatic command completion, smart suggestions for tons of CLI tools, and numerous
                quality-of-life improvements for users, Warp aims to optimize every developer’s workflow.

            Through Brown’s CSCI 1300 course on interaction design, we’ve been tasked to design a community page for
                Warp in an official partnership through Google Ventures. Warp Community is where users share everything
                from simple workflows to complex automations, even if they’re an individual hobbyist dev or an industry
                professional who relies on Warp every day.

            After being onboarded to the project, we began familiarizing ourselves with Warp, its AI-augmented terminal
            sessions,
            and the “meta” <span class="highlight-white">objects</span> (Prompts, Workflows, Environment Variables, and
            Notebooks) used, saved, and retrieved in local use of Warp.
            In addition to surveying <span class="highlight-white">competitors</span> (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code,
            and Devin),
            we arrived at the present factors to inform our design of Warp Community:

            We started off by independently brainstorming designs for Warp Community, and drawing up the following

            group-sketch on some whiteboards.

            Consolidating, we wrapped all sorts of variations on content–such as “article”, “text thread”, “note”, and
            more–into a single “post” entity that is the core unit of information for Warp Community objects. We
            realized too many forms of information potentially create confusion and mental overload for the user (i.e.
            avoiding four different forms for each object type). Technical users share their objects within posts (with
            great flexibility offered via markdown). A unified component brings consistency and immediate familiarity to
            the user.

            We mocked up our whiteboard-synthesizing of our sketches into lo-fi wireframes using Balsamiq.

        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 30px; color:white">Wireframe Feedback</h4>
        <p>
            A weekend later, we got some feedback from the Warp team and met with Vanessa Cho, VP at Google Design. She
            gave us a ton of super crucial feedback - which was to focus on the success metrics. Our design so far had
            focused on providing a Warp Community interface to house shared Warp objects, but there was nothing that
            prioritized the Warp Terminal user. We didn’t connect the sharing platform with the app itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is something the Warp team also mentioned - why would one use Warp Community over Reddit, X, or
            HackerNews? We needed to provide a competitive advantage, one that would maximize user contribution rate,
            user implementation rate (usage in Warp Terminal), and most critically save time and boost engagement.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another thing we realized was less is more. In our hyper-focused approach, we had added a lot of vestigial
            components that would not be relevant to a Warp Terminal user. The users’ main pain point is about
            presenting, viewing, and utilizing information in an orderly, speedy fashion. How could we connect users
            within the Warp Terminal in a beneficial way with Warp Community?

        <p>
            So back to the whiteboard we went, and decided to think critically about the pathways users would take
            between Warp Community and Warp Terminal. As in, how does a workflow from someone’s Warp Drive actually end
            up on Warp Community? How does that same workflow save another user 3 hours of development effort?

        <p>We quickly wrote up a technical document discussing this new redesign in much more detail than before, and

                            Now that our designs spanned both features within the Warp Terminal and a Warp community
                            platform, we created a design style guide for consistent components. This was key for the
                            cards that represented objects which appeared during a terminal session or a Warp Community
                            search.

                            In closing the sharing loop, it needed to be as easy as possible for a user to both run a
                            shared object and share their own.

                <p>
                    Warp Community begins with a session in Warp Terminal where users begin their AI-assistant terminal
                    work. Just as the LLM provides suggestions to a user’s workflow, relevant objects are pulled from
                    Warm Community to augment the LLM response and displayed as cards below the prompt which can
                    immediately be run with a single click. Our vision was to make it as easy as possible to use Warp
                    Community content for the average Warp user -- no need to go out of one’s way. Users can also

                <p>
                    A more targeted, searchable version of suggested community objects is available in the Warp Command
                    Palette. We extended existing UI used for quick access to a user’s local Warp Drive objects to also
                    have quick access to Warp Community shared objects.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, these shared objects are easily viewable and forkable in a seamless integration with the user’s
                    personal Warp Drive. Our cards are simply a UI wrapper around the core object. Since all objects are
                    stored in one’s Warp Drive, we added a one-click step to publish content directly to Warp Community.
                    This continues our vision to make it just as easy to share content to Warp Community.
                    Below, we've summarized the affordances available in this sharing "loop".
                </p>

                <div class="card-container">
                    <div class="card" style="width: 600px; margin-right: 1rem;">
                        <p style="line-height:0.5; padding-top:10px; color: white;">Implementing Content</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Natural language prompt requesting help retrieves relevant content from WC, search-engine style</li>
                            <li>General language prompt receives suggestions from WC</li>
                            <li>Warp command palette offers in-app searchable WC</li>
                            <li>Warp community webpage is external hub for content</li>
                            <li>Managing the version of the object on Warp Community</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card" style="width: 600px; margin-left: 1rem;">
                        <p style="line-height:0.5; padding-top:10px; color: white;">Sharing Content</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Publish any object within one's local WC</li>
                            <li>View and fork suggested WC content within the local Warp app to customize and re-share to WC</li>
                            <li>Warp Community webpage metrics incentivize sharing with # stars, # forks, and # implements tracked</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    We finally designed an external, web interface for Warp Community separate from the Warp Terminal.
                    Here users are able to search and explore shared content independent of a working session within
                    Warp Terminal. The landing page turns into a Discovery page upon scrolling, with both recommended
                    and trending objects. Using the search bar turns Discovery into Searching. Objects (and their cards)
                    are neatly rendered in full pages, optimized for reading over development experience.
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                
                <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; width: 100%">
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; width: 100%; margin-right: 2rem;">
                        <p>
                            As just discussed, our wireframe were split between screens for Warp Terminal and screens for Warp Community.
                            This split created additional complexity since we wanted to help users seamlessly transition between the two and avoid high cognitive load.
                            We used Figma's prototyping system to both model and track the interaction flows between all these screens. 
                            This is visualized on the right.

            We demonstrate our final design in the following Loom video. We walk through the implementation interaction flows 
            (using content from Warp community in the current session) and the sharing interaction flows 
            (publishing content to Warp community). We also demonstrate the web interface for Warp Community and how it re-integrates with the Warp Terminal.
            These are facilitated by extensive prototyping, interaction, and flow set-ups in Figma.

        <p>
            We soon met with Warp's design team to present our version of Warp Community and receive a final round of feedback.
            <br><br>
            <span class="dropcap">1</span>Their key insight was to further consider the unique scope of Warp, namely the fact that 
            <span class="highlight-white">the Warp app was an actual console terminal with terminal users</span>.
            This brought additional design considerations that we hadn't factored in: constraints that come with terminal environments and UI.
            Our card design that facilitated implementation and sharing required mouse clicking which neglects many 
            <span class="highlight-white">keyboard-only power users</span> (hello from VIM!).
            This led to a productive discussion on introducing tabbing order and a numbering scheme amenable to intuitive keyboard shortcuts.
            <br><br>

            <span class="dropcap">2</span>The Warp team was also happy to see our integration of object creation and publication flow into the local Warp Drive.
            However, they brought up a great point for future demonstrations to consider the terminal pane setup of these interaction flows that move between different app states.
            Indeed, <span class="highlight-white">developers often obssess over their IDE and terminal configurations</span>, so greater care would help create an even better product.
            While we piggy-backed off the existing object pane system, in the future we could wireframe additional terminal layouts to see what our proposal looks like across 
            a wider gamut of users. 
            <br><br>

            <span class="dropcap">3</span>Finally, we discussed the 
            <span class="highlight-white">implications of interfacing users with large language models compared to traditional search and recommendation algorithms</span>
            (e.g. the core AI terminal session v.s. suggestions from local Warp Drive). 
            Our design of Warp Community heavily relies on "pulling" content from the centralized hub to a local Warp session,
            and this could work in either direction. LLMs have incredible flexibility and reasoning powers, yet they hallucinate and are preceived as unreliable.
            Meanwhile user-validated content from a search algorithm has high-trust but cannot cover as much scenario ground. 
            These case-by-base tradeoffs are constant considerations in designing for AI tools such as Warp.

        <h4 style="color: rgb(130 160 121); padding-top: 30px">Team Takeaways</h4>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom: 30px; color:white">What We Learned</h4>

        <p>
            This was a great experience for us to work with a real company and product.
            We practiced iterative design out of necessity and, in retrospect, saw first-hand how the process arrives at a product that betters serves the user.
            Our hi-fi prototype was a vast improvement from where we started.
            In this process, we learned to ask questions and the importance of asking them <i>soon</i>. 
            Our initial direction headed off-course and we could have saved everyone's time by asking the right questions earlier.
            <br><br>

            We also learned that the design sits in context of the product, where it is used, and the goals of the company.
            Our initial fixation on community platform-building stemmed from losing sight of the project's defined success metrics,
            which center around increasing user productivity/engagement/retention of the Warp Terminal itself. 
            In defining the relation of Warp Community to Warp Terminal, we were able to iteratively arrive at a proposal that the Warp Team was excited to receive.
            <br><br>

            Finally, we would like to thank the Warp team for the opportunity to design on their product and great feedback throughout the process.
            We would also like to thank Vanessa Cho from Google Design for her mentorship and guidance throughout the project and the
            course staff for Brown's CSCI 1300 Interaction Design course.
