                    Warp is a startup trying to modernize the conventional terminal with artificial intelligence features. With features like automatic command completion, smart suggestions for tons of CLI tools, and numerous quality-of-life improvements for users, Warp aims to optimize every developer’s workflow. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Through Brown’s CSCI 1300 course on interaction design, we’ve been tasked to design a community page for Warp in an official partnership through Google Ventures. Warp Community is where users share everything from simple workflows to complex automations, even if they’re an individual hobbyist dev or an industry professional who relies on Warp every day.

                    After being onboarded to the project, we began familiarizing ourselves with Warp, its AI-augmented terminal sessions, 
                    and the “meta” <span class="highlight-white">objects</span> (Prompts, Workflows, Environment Variables, and Notebooks) used, saved, and retrieved in local use of Warp. 
                    In addition to surveying <span class="highlight-white">competitors</span> (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code, and Devin), 
                    we arrived at the present factors to inform our design of Warp Community:

                    They typically work in small to medium-sized teams, are technology early adopters, and value both practical solutions and innovation. 
                    They regularly use AI devtools but feel they're not maximizing their potential.

                <p>
                    We started off by independently brainstorming designs for Warp Community, and drawing up the following sketches. Afterwards, we came together and synthesized components we liked from each member into a group-sketch on some whiteboards.

                <p>
                    Consolidating, we wrapped all sorts of variations on content–such as “article”, “text thread”, “note”, and more–into a single “post” entity that is the core unit of information for Warp Community objects. We realized too many forms of information potentially create confusion and mental overload for the user (i.e. avoiding four different forms for each object type). Technical users share their objects within posts (with great flexibility offered via markdown). A unified component brings consistency and immediate familiarity to the user.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We mocked up our whiteboard-synthesizing of our sketches into lo-fi wireframes using Balsamiq.

                <h4 style="margin-bottom: 30px; color:white">Wireframe Feedback</h4>
                <p>
                    A weekend later, we got some feedback from the Warp team and met with Vanessa Cho, VP at Google Design. She gave us a ton of super crucial feedback - which was to focus on the success metrics. Our design so far had focused on providing a Warp Community interface to house shared Warp objects, but there was nothing that prioritized the Warp Terminal user. We didn’t connect the sharing platform with the app itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is something the Warp team also mentioned - why would one use Warp Community over Reddit, X, or HackerNews? We needed to provide a competitive advantage, one that would maximize user contribution rate, user implementation rate (usage in Warp Terminal), and most critically save time and boost engagement. 
                    <br>
                    <br>    
                    Another thing we realized was less is more. In our hyper-focused approach, we had added a lot of vestigial components that would not be relevant to a Warp Terminal user. The users’ main pain point is about presenting, viewing, and utilizing information in an orderly, speedy fashion. How could we connect users within the Warp Terminal in a beneficial way with Warp Community?

                <p>
                    So back to the whiteboard we went, and decided to think critically about the pathways users would take between Warp Community and Warp Terminal. As in, how does a workflow from someone’s Warp Drive actually end up on Warp Community? How does that same workflow save another user 3 hours of development effort?

                <p>We quickly wrote up a technical document discussing this new redesign in much more detail than before, and sent it over to the Warp team. They were pleased with this new perspective, and our new strategy was successful! </p>

                            Now that our designs spanned both features within the Warp Terminal and a Warp community platform, we created a design style guide for consistent components. This was key for the cards that represented objects which appeared during a terminal session or a Warp Community search.

                            In closing the sharing loop, it needed to be as easy as possible for a user to both run a shared object and share their own.
